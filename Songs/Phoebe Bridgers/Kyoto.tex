\begin{verse}
Day off in ^{B}Kyoto, got bored at the ^{B}temple. \\
Looked around at the ^{E}7-Eleven ^{E} \\
The band took the speed ^{B}train, went to the ^{B}arcade. \\
I wanted to ^{E}go, but I didn't ^{E} \\  
You called me from a ^{B}payphone, they still got ^{B}payphones \\
It cost a ^{E}dollar a minute ^{E} \\
To tell me you're getting ^{B}sober and you wrote me a ^{B}letter \\
But I ^{E}don't have to read it ^{E}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{C#m}I'm ^{E}gonna ^{B}kill you if ^{F#}you don't beat me to it
^{C#m}drea- ^{E}ming through ^{G#m}Tokyo ^{D#m}skies \\
I ^{C#m}wanted to ^{E}see the ^{B}world then I ^{F#}flew over the ocean
^{C#m} and I ^{E}changed my ^{B}mi- ^{F#}iiii- ^{E}ind ^{E}(woo)
\end{chorus}

\begin{solo} 
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllllllll}

\end{tabular}
\end{solo}

\begin{verse}
Sunset's been a ^{B}freak show on the week^{B}end \\
So I've been driving ^{E}out to the suburbs ^{E} \\
To park at the ^{B}Goodwill and stare at the ^{B}chemtrails \\
With ^{E}my little brother ^{E} \\
He said you called on his ^{B}birthday, you were off by like ^{B}ten days \\
But you get a ^{E}few points for tryin' ^{E} \\
Remember getting the ^{B}truck fixed when you let us ^{B}drive it \\
Twenty-^{E}five felt like flying ^{E} \hspace{10pt} ^{E}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{C#m}I ^{E}don't for^{B}give you but ^{F#}please don't hold me to it. \hspace{10pt}
^{C#m}Born ^{E}under ^{G#m}Scorpio ^{D#m}skies \\
I ^{C#m}wanted to ^{E}see the ^{B}world through your ^{F#}eyes until it happened
^{C#m} then I ^{E}changed my ^{B}mi- ^{C#}iiii- ^{E}ind
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
Guess I ^{B}li- ^{C#}iiii- ^{E}ied \hspace{10pt}
I'm a ^{B}li- ^{C#}iiiii- ^{E}iar \hspace{10pt}
Who ^{B}li- ^{C#}iiii- ^{E}ies \hspace{10pt}
'Cause I'm a ^{B}li- ^{C#}iiii- ^{E}iar

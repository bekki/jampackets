\begin{verse}
^{C}I was walking through icy streams that took my breath away \\
^{Am}Moving slowly through westward water, over glacial plains \\
And I walked off ^{F}you... ^{C}and I walked off an ^{Am}old me \\
Oh ^{F}me oh my I ^{C}thought it was a ^{Am}dream, so it seemed
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F} And now breathe ^{Am}deep, I'm inhal^{Em}ing...  You and I, there's air in between \\
^{F} Leave me be, ^{Am} I'm exhal^{Em}ing... You and I, there's air in between \\
^{F} Wooo oooh, wooo ^{Am}oooh, wooo oooh oooh, ^{Em} wooo oooh oooh... You and I, there's air in between \\
^{F} Wooo oooh, wooo ^{Am}oooh, wooo oooh oooh, ^{Em} wooo oooh oooh... 
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{C}Cut my hair so I could rock back and forth without thinking of you \\
^{Am}Learn to talk and say whatever I wanted to \\
And I walked off ^{F}you... ^{C}and I walked off an ^{Am}old me \\
Oh ^{F}me oh my I ^{C}thought it was a ^{Am}dream, so it seemed 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F} And now breathe ^{Am}deep, I'm inhal^{Em}ing...  You and I, there's air in between \\

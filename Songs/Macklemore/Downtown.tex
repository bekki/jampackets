    ^{C#-}Whitewalls on the ^{G#}wheels like mayonnaise \\

    ^{C#-}Very rare, mom jeans ^{G#}on her derriere \\

    Stone ^{C#-}washed, so raw,
    moped like a ^{G#}bullet \\
    ^{A#m}Yeeooow! You can't catch me,
    a ^{C#-}po-po can't repri^{G#}mand me.
    I'm in a ^{A#m}B-Boy stance, I'm not dancing \\

    \instruction{Macklemore} \\
    It's ^{A#m}me, the M, the A-C, the K,
    ^{C#-}sounding like a French pimp from ^{G#}back in the day \\
    I take her to ^{A#m}Pend Oreille and I watch her skate,
    I mean, ^{C#-}water ski, ollie ollie ^{G#}oxen free \\
    I'm ^{A#m}perusing down Fourth and they watching me \hspace{20pt}
    I do a ^{C#-}handstand, the eagle lands ^{G#}on my seat \\
    Well ^{A#m}hello, but baby, the kickstand ain't free,

    I got ^{A#m}one girl, I got two wheels,
    she a ^{C#-}big girl, that ain't a ^{G#}big deal \\
    I like a ^{A#m}big girl, I like 'em sassy,
    going down the ^{C#-}backstreet listening to B^{G#}lackstreet \\
    ^{A#m}Running around the whole town,
    ^{C#-}neighbors yelling at me like, ^{G#}"You need to slow down" \\
    Going ^{A#m}38, Dan, chill the fuck out,
    ^{C#-}mow your damn lawn and sit the ^{G#}hell down \\
    If I ^{A#m}only had one helmet I would give it to ^{C#-}you, give it to ^{G#}you \\
    ^{A#m}Cruising down Broadway, girl, what a wonderful ^{C#-}view, wonderful ^{G#}view \\
    There's ^{A#m}layers to this shit player, tira^{C#-}misu, tira^{G#}misu \\
    Let my ^{A#m}coat-tail drag but I ain't tearing my s^{C#-}uit, tearing my s^{G#}uit

^{Eb} I've waited a hundred years, ^{Eb} I'd wait a million more ^{Ab}for you ^{Ab} \\
^{Eb} Nothing prepared me for ^{Eb}what the privilege of being yours ^{Ab}would do ^{Ab}

^{Bb-} If I had ^{Cm}only felt the ^{Ab-}warmth within your ^{Eb}touch \\
^{Bb-} If I had ^{Cm}only seen how you ^{Ab-}smile when you ^{Eb}blush \\
^{Bb-} Or how you ^{Cm}curl your lip when you ^{Ab-}concentrate e^{Eb}nough, I would have ^{Bb}known \\
What I was living ^{Cm-}for all a^{Ab}long, what I've been living ^{Eb}for

\begin{verse}
^{Eb} Your love is my turning page ^{Eb} where only the sweetest words rema^{Ab}in \hspace{10pt} ^{Ab} \\
^{Eb-} Every kiss is a ^{Gm}cursive line, ^{Cm-} every touch is a ^{Bb}redefined ^{Ab}phrase ^{Ab}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Bb-} I ^{Cm}surrender who I've ^{Ab-}been for who you ^{Eb}are  \\
^{Bb-} Nothing ^{Cm}makes me stronger ^{Ab-}than your fragile ^{Eb}heart \\
^{Bb-} If I had ^{Cm}only felt how it ^{Ab-}feels to be ^{Eb}yours then I would have ^{Bb}known \\
What I've been living ^{Cm-}for all ^{Ab}along, ^{Ab}what I've been living ^{Eb}for \hspace{10pt} ^{Eb}

^{(Ab)}Though we're tethered ^{Bb} to the story we must ^{Ab}tell \\
When I saw you, ^{Bb} well I knew we'd tell it ^{Ab}well \\
With a whisper ^{Bb} we will tame the vicious ^{Ab}seas \\
Like a feather ^{Bb} bring the kingdoms to their ^{Eb}knees

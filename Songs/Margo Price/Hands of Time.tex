\begin{intro}
_{A}
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{A}When I rolled out of town on the unpaved road, \hspace{10pt} 
^{E}I was fifty-seven dollars from being broke \\
^{A}Kissed my mama and my sisters and I said goodbye, \hspace{10pt}
And ^{A7}with my suitcase packed I wiped the ^{D}tears from my ^{A}eyes     ^{E}  \\
^{A}Times they were tough growing up at home, \hspace{10pt}
^{E}My daddy lost the farm when I was two years old \\
^{A}Took a job at the prison working second shift, \hspace{10pt}
And ^{A7}that's the last time I let them ^{D}take what should be ^{A}his     ^{E}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
\begin{tabbing}
\textbf{1.}Cause \=^{G}all I wanna do is make a little cash, \hspace{5pt} cause I \=^{C}worked all the bad jobs, bustin' my hands \\
\textbf{2.}Cause \>all I wanna do is make something last, but I  \>can't see the future, I can't change the past \\
\textbf{3.}Cause \>all I wanna do is make my own path, cause I  \>know what I am, I know what I have
\end{tabbing}
I wanna ^{G}buy back the farm and bring my mama home some wine \\
And ^{D}turn back the clock on the ^{C}cruel hands of ^{G}time     ^{E}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{A}When I hit the city, I joined the band, \hspace{10pt}
Started ^{E}singing in the bars and running with the men \\
But the ^{A}men they brought me problems and the drinking caused me grief, \hspace{10pt}
I ^{A7}thought I'd found a friend but I o^{D}nly found a t^{A}hief      ^{E}  \\
^{A}Soon I settled down with a married man, \hspace{10pt}
We ^{E}had a couple babies, started living off the land \\
But ^{A}my firstborn died and I cried out to God, \hspace{10pt}
Is there ^{A7}anybody up there lookin' ^{D}down on me at ^{A}all?      ^{E}
\end{verse}

\begin{solo}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllllllll}
    |_{C} & |_{C} & |_{G} & |_{G} & |_{D} & |_{C} & |_{G} & |_{G} & | \\ 
    \end{tabular}
\end{solo}

\begin{verse}
^{A}Still I keep a-running fast as I can, \hspace{10pt}
Trying to ^{E}make something honest with my own two hands \\
And ^{A}I ain't got the breath to say another bad word, \hspace{10pt}
So if I ^{A7}ever said it wrong won't you for^{D}get what you ^{A}heard     ^{E}
\end{verse}

\begin{outro}
^{D}\hspace{1pt} Cruuuuu^{C}uuuel hands of ^{G}time ^{G}  \instruction{3x}\\

\begin{verse}
^{A}Where are ^{E}we? \hspace{20pt} ^{F#m}What the ^{D}hell is ^{A}going ^{E}on? \\
The ^{F#m}dust has ^{D}only ^{A}just ^{E}begun to ^{F#m}form
crop ^{D}circles in the ^{A}carpet, ^{E}sinking, ^{F#m}feeling... ^{D} \\
^{A}Spin me ^{E}'round ^{F#m}again and ^{D}rub my ^{A}eyes, this ^{E}can't be ^{F#m}happen- ^{D}ing \\
When ^{A}busy ^{E}streets a^{F#m}mass with ^{D}people would stop
to ^{A}hold ^{E}their heads ^{F#m}heavy ^{D} \instruction{pause}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{A}Hide ^{E}and ^{F#m}seek \hspace{20pt} ^{D}trains and ^{F#m}sewing machines \\
^{A}All ^{E}those ^{F#m}years  \hspace{20pt}  ^{D}they were ^{E}here first
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{A}Oily ^{E}marks ^{F#m}appear on ^{D}walls where ^{A}pleasure ^{E}moments ^{F#m}hung ^{D}before \\
the ^{A}take- ove^{E}r, the ^{F#m}sweeping ^{D}insensitivity ^{A}of this ^{E}still ^{F#m}life ^{D} \instruction{pause}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{A}Hide ^{E}and ^{F#m}seek \hspace{20pt} ^{D}trains and ^{F#m}sewing machines? (Oh, you won't catch me around here) \\
^{A}blood ^{E}and ^{F#m}tears \hspace{20pt} ^{D}they were ^{E}here first 
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{D}Mmm what you ^{A}say? Oh that you ^{F#m}only meant wel^{E}l, well of course you did \\
^{D}Mmm what you sa^{A}y? Mmm that it's ^{F#m}all for the ^{E}best, of course it is \\
^{D}Mmm what you sa^{A}y? That it's ^{F#m}just what we ^{E}need, you decided this \\
^{D}Mmm what you ^{A}say... ^{F#m}What did she ^{E}say? 
\end{bridge}

\begin{outro}
^{A}Ransom notes keep ^{E}falling at your mouth, ^{F#m}mid-sweet talk, news^{D}paper word cut outs \\
^{A}Speak no feeling, no, ^{E}I don't believe you, ^{F#m}You don't care a bit, you ^{D}don't care a bit

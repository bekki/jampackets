\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{G} Your eyes, so crisp, so green \hspace{20pt}
^{Dm7}Sour apple baby, but you taste so sweet \\
You got ^{C}hips like Jagger and two left feet \hspace{20pt}
And I ^{Am7}wonder if you'd like to meet \\
^{G} Your voice is velvet through a telephone \hspace{20pt}
^{Dm7}You can come to mine, but both my roommates are home \\
^{C}Think I know a bar where they would leave us alone \hspace{20pt}
And I ^{Am7}wonder if you'd take it slow
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
^{G} Oh, we're dancin' in my ^{Dm7}living room and up come my fists \hspace{10pt}
^{C} And I say I'm only ^{Am7}playing but the truth is this \\
^{G} That I've never seen a ^{Dm7}mouth that I would kill to kiss \hspace{10pt} 
^{C} And I'm terrified, but I ^{Am7}can't resist and I say 
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
^{G} Beautiful stranger, here you ^{Dm7}are in my arms and I know \\
^{C} That beautiful strangers only come al^{Am7}ong to do me wrong \\
And I hope, ^{G} beautiful stranger, here you ^{Dm7}are in my arms \\
But I think it's ^{C}finally, finally, finally, finally, finally ^{Am7}safe for me to fall
\end{chorus}

\begin{postchorus}
^{G} Oh-oh-^{Dm7}oh, Oh-oh-^{C}oh   ^{Am7}
\end{postchorus}

\begin{verse}
^{G} I grab your hand and then we run to the car \hspace{20pt}
^{Dm7}Singing in the street and playing air guitar \\
^{C}Stuck between my teeth just like a candy bar \hspace{20pt}
And I ^{Am7}wonder if it goes too far to say \\
^{G} I've never recognized a purer face \hspace{20pt}
You ^{Dm7}stopped me in my tracks and put me right in my place \\
^{C}Used to think that loving meant a painful chase \hspace{20pt}
But you're ^{Am7}right here now and I think you'll stay
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
^{G} Oh, we're dancin' in my ^{Dm7}living room and up come my fists \hspace{10pt}
^{C} And I say I'm only ^{Am7}playing but the truth is this \\
^{G} I've never seen a ^{Dm7}mouth that I would kill to kiss \hspace{10pt}
^{C} And I'm terrified, but the ^{Am7}truth is this, I say
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
\instruction{Repeat Chorus}
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
^{G} Oh-oh-^{Dm7}oh, Oh-oh-o^{C}h  ^{Am7}    \\
Yeah, I think it's finally, finally, finally, ^{G}finally...

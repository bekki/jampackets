  \begin{verse}
    I've got a ^{D}cupboard with cans of ^{G}food, filtered ^{D}water, and pictures of ^{G}you \\
    I'm not ^{D}coming out until ^{G}this is all over ^{D} \hspace{10pt} ^{G}  \\
    And I'm ^{D}looking through the ^{G}glass where the ^{D}light bends at the ^{G}cracks \\
    And I'm scr^{D}eaming at the top of my ^{G}lungs pre^{D}tending the echoes be^{G}long to someone \\
    (^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo...) ^{Em}Someone I used to ^{D}know... ^{D} \hspace{10pt} ^{D} ^{D} \\
    And we ^{Em}become (doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo) \\
    ^{Em}Silhouettes when our bodies finally ^{D}go (Ba ^{G}ba ba ^{D}ba...) ^{G} \hspace{10pt} ^{D} (Ba ^{G}ba ba ^{D}ba...)
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    I wanted to ^{D}walk through the ^{G}empty streets and feel something ^{D}constant under my ^{G}feet \\
    But all the ^{D}news reports reco^{G}mmended that I stay indoors ^{D} \hspace{10pt} ^{G}  \\
    Because the ^{D}air outside will ^{G}make our cells ^{D}divide at an alarming ^{G}rate \\
    Until our ^{D}shells simply cannot ^{G}hold all our ^{D}insides in   \\
    And ^{G}that's when we'll ex^{Em}plode... (^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo...) and it won't be a pretty ^{D}sight ^{D} \\
  \end{verse}

  \begin{bridge}
    ^{Em}And we'll become (^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo, ^{Em}doo doo...) silhouettes when our bodies ^{D}finally go (^{D}Ba ba ^{D}ba ba...) \\
    And ^{D}we'll become (we'll become, ^{D}we'll become...) silhouettes ^{D}when our bodies finally ^{D}go (^{D}Ba ba, ba ba...) ^{D} \\
    And we'll be^{D}come (we'll become, ^{D}we'll become...) silhouettes ^{D}when our bodies finally ^{D}go (Ba ^{D}ba, ba ba...) \\
    And we'll be^{D}come (we'll become, ^{D}we'll become...) silhouettes when our ^{D}bodies finally go

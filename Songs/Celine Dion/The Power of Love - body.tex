\begin{verse}
The whispers in the ^{G#}morning of lovers sleeping ^{Fm}tight \\
Are rolling like ^{G#}thunder now as I look in your ^{D#}eyes \\
I hold on to your ^{G#}body and feel each move you ^{Fm}make \\
Your voice is warm and ^{C#}tender, a love that I ^{G#/C}could not ^{D#}forsake
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause I am your ^{G#}lady and you are my ^{C#}man \\
Whenever you ^{A#m}reach for me, I'll do all that I ^{D#}can
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Lost is how I'm ^{G#}feeling lying in your ^{Fm}arms, \\
When the world ^{G#}outside's too much to take. That all ends when I'm with ^{D#}you \\
Even though there may be ^{G#}times it seems I'm far ^{Fm}away \\
Never wonder ^{C#}where I am 'cause I am ^{G#/C}always by your ^{D#}side.
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause I am your ^{G#}lady and you are my ^{C#}man \\
Whenever you ^{A#m}reach for me, I'll do all that I ^{D#}can \\
We're heading for ^{G#}something, somewhere I've never ^{C#}been \\
Sometimes I am ^{A#m}frightened but I'm ready to ^{D#}learn of the ^{C#}power of ^{G#}love
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{C#}The ^{D#}sound of your heart ^{G#}beating ^{C#} made it ^{D#}clear sudden^{Fm}ly ^{C#} \\
The ^{D#}feeling that I ^{G#}can't go on ^{C#}is light years away^{D#-} ^{C#-} ^{D#}
\end{bridge}

\begin{chorus}
^{D#-} ^{C#-} ^{D#} 'Cause I am your ^{G#}lady and you are my ^{C#}man \\
Whenever you ^{A#m}reach for me, I'm gonna do all that I ^{D#}can \\
We're heading for ^{G#}something, somewhere I've never ^{C#}been \\
Sometimes I am ^{A#m}frightened but I'm ready to ^{D#}learn of the ^{C#}power of ^{G#}love
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
The power of ^{G#}love... the power of ^{C#}love \\
Sometimes I am ^{A#m}frightened but I'm ready to ^{D#}learn of the ^{C#}power of ^{G#}love
\instruction{solo out on this chord}
\end{outro}

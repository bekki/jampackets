  \begin{intro}
    _{Am}
  \end{intro}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} We are two mariners, ^{Am} our ships' sole survivors {Am} in this belly of a ^{E}whale \\
    ^{E} Its ribs our ceiling beams, ^{E} its guts our carpeting ^{E} I guess we have some time to ^{Am}kill \\
    ^{Am} You may not remember me, ^{Am} I was a child of three and you a lad of eigh^{E}teen \\
    ^{E} But I remember you and ^{E} I will relay to you ^{E} how our histories inter^{Am}weave \\
    ^{F}At the time you were a ^{F}rake and a rousta^{Am}bout \\
    ^{F}Spending all your money ^{F}on the whores and ^{E}hounds, ^{F-}oh  ^{E}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} You had a charming air, ^{Am} all cheap and debonair,
    ^{Am} my widowed mother found so swe^{E}et \\
    ^{E} And so she took you in, ^{E} her sheets still warm with him
      ^{E} now filled with filth and foul dis^{Am}ease \\
    As ^{F}time wore on you proved a ^{F}debt-ridden drunken ^{Am}mess \\
    ^{F}Leaving my mother a ^{F}poor consumptive ^{E}wretch, ^{F-}oh ^{E}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} And then you disappeared, ^{Am} your gambling arrears,
    ^{Am} the only thing you left be^{E}hind \\
    ^{E} And then the magistrate ^{E} reclaimed our small estate
      ^{E} and my poor mother lost her ^{Am}mind \\
    ^{F}Then one day in spring my ^{F}dear sweet mother ^{Am}died \\
    But be^{F}fore she did I took her ^{F}hand as she dying ^{E}cried, ^{F-}oh ^{E}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    "^{Dm}Find him, bind him, ^{Dm}tie him to a pole and break his \\
    ^{Am}Fingers to splinters, ^{Am}drag him to a hole until he \\
    ^{Dm}Wakes up naked, ^{Dm}clawing at the ceiling of his ^{E}grave" ^{F-E}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} It took me fifteen years ^{Am} to swallow all my tears
      ^{Am} among the urchins in the ^{E}street \\
    ^{E} Until a priory ^{E} took pity and hired me
      ^{E} To keep their vestry nice and ^{Am}neat \\
    But ^{F}never once in the em^{F}ploy of these holy men ^{Am} \\
    Did ^{F}I ever once stir my ^{F}mind from the thought of re^{E}venge, ^{F-}oh  ^{E}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} One night I overheard ^{Am} the prior exchanging words
      ^{Am} with a penitent whaler from the ^{E}sea \\
    ^{E} The captain of his ship ^{E} who matched you toe to tip
      ^{E} was known for wanton cruel^{Am}ty \\
    The ^{F}following day I shipped to ^{F}sea with a priva^{Am}teer \\
    And ^{F}in the whistle of the ^{F}wind I could almost ^{E}hear, ^{F-}oh ^{E}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    "^{Dm}Find him, bind him, ^{Dm}tie him to a pole and break his \\
    ^{Am}Fingers to splinters, drag him to a hole until he \\

  \begin{verse}
    \instruction{quietly grim}
    ^{Am}And then that fateful night ^{Am} we had you in our sight
      ^{Am} after twenty months at ^{E}sea \\
    ^{E} Your starboard flank a beam, ^{E} I was getting my muskets clean
      ^{E} when came this rumbling from ^{Am}beneath \\
    \instruction{louder, more intense, rumbling}
    The ^{F}ocean stirred the sky went ^{F}black and the captain ^{Am}quailed \\
    And ^{F}before us grew the angry ^{F}jaws of a giant ^{E}whale, \instruction{add background sounds: \emoji{whale} \emoji{scream}\emoji{scream}\emoji{scream}} ^{F-}oh  ^{E}

  \begin{verse}
    \instruction{back to normal} \\
    ^{Am} Don't know how I survived, ^{Am} the crew all was chewed alive,
    ^{Am} I must have slipped between his ^{E}teeth \\
    ^{E} But oh what providence, ^{E} what divine intelligence
      ^{E} that you should survive as well as ^{Am}me \\
    It ^{F}gives my heart great joy ^{F} to see your eyes fill with ^{Am}fear \\
    So ^{F}lean in close and I will ^{F}whisper the last words you'll ^{E}hear, ^{F-}oh  ^{E}

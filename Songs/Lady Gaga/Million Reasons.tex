\begin{verse}
You're ^{C}giving me a million reasons to let you go, \hspace{10pt} 
You're ^{Am}giving me a million reasons to quit the show \\
You're ^{F}givin' me a million reasons, give me a million reasons, \hspace{10pt}  
^{G}Givin' me a million reasons, about a million reasons \\
^{C}If I had a highway, I would run for the hills, \hspace{10pt} 
If ^{Am}you could find a dryway, I'd forever be still \\
But you're ^{F}giving me a million reasons, give me a million reasons, \hspace{10pt} 
^{G}Givin' me a million reasons, about a million reasons
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{F}I bow ^{C}down to ^{Am}pray, I try to make the ^{G}worst seem better \hspace{10pt}  
^{F}Lord, show ^{C}me the ^{Am}way to cut through all his ^{G}worn out leather \\
^{F}I've got a ^{C}hundred million ^{Am}reasons to walk ^{G}away 
but ^{F}baby, I just need one good one to stay 
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{C}Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare, \hspace{10pt} 
It's ^{Am}like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware \\ 
'Cause you're ^{F}giving me a million reasons, give me a million reasons, \hspace{10pt} 
^{G}Givin' me a million reasons, about a million reasons \\ 
^{C}And if you say something that you might even mean, \hspace{10pt} 
It's ^{Am}hard to even fathom which parts I should believe \\ 
'Cause you're ^{F}giving me a million reasons, give me a million reasons, \hspace{10pt} 
^{G}Givin' me a million reasons, about a million reasons
\end{verse}

^{F}I bow ^{C}down to ^{Am}pray, I try to make the ^{G}worst seem better \hspace{10pt}  
^{F}Lord, show ^{C}me the ^{Am}way to cut through all his ^{G}worn out leather \\

^{Am}ehh ^{F}ehh- ee^{C}eh can't you give me what I'm ^{G}needin', needin' \\
^{F}Every heart^{C}break makes it ^{G}hard to keep the ^{Am}faith

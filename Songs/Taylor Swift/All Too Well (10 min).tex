    \end{tabular}
  \end{intro}

  \begin{verse}
    I ^{C}walked through the door with you, ^{G} the air was cold
    but ^{Am}something 'bout it felt like ^{F}home somehow \\
    And I ^{C}left my scarf there at your ^{G}sister's house
    and you ^{Am}still got it, in your ^{F}drawer, even now
  \end{verse}

  \begin{interlude}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}
      |_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |
    \end{tabular}
  \end{interlude}

  \begin{verse}
    Oh your ^{C}sweet disposition and my ^{G}wide eyed gaze,
    we're ^{Am}singing in the car getting ^{F}lost upstate \\
    The ^{C}autumn leaves falling down like ^{G}pieces into place
    and I ^{Am}can picture it after ^{F}all these days
  \end{verse}

  \begin{prechorus}
    And I ^{C}know it's long gone and that ^{G}magic's not here no more \\
    and I ^{Am}might be okay but I'm not ^{G}fine at al^{F-G}l ^{Am-G}
  \end{prechorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    'Cause ^{C}there we are again on that ^{G}little town street \\
    You ^{Am}almost ran the red 'cause you were ^{F}lookin' over at me \\
    Wind in my ^{C}hair, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well ^{F}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Photo ^{C}album on the counter, your ^{G}cheeks were turning red.
    You used to be a ^{Am}little kid with glasses in a ^{F}twin size bed \\
    And your ^{C}mother's telling stories 'bout you on a ^{G}t-ball team.
    You ^{Am}taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your ^{F}future was me
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    And you were ^{C}tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the ^{G}patriarchy" \\
    keychain on the ^{Am}ground, we were always skippin' ^{F}town \\
    And I was ^{C}thinkin' on the drive down, "Any ^{G}time now,
    he's gonna say it's ^{Am}love," you never called it what it ^{F}was \\
    'Til we were ^{C}dead and gone and buried, check the ^{G}pulse and come back swearin' \\
    it's the ^{Am}same after three ^{F}months in the grave \\
    And then you ^{C}wondered where it went to as I ^{G}reached for you \\
    But all I felt was ^{Am}shame and you held my lifeless ^{F}frame
  \end{verse}

  \begin{prechorus}
    And I ^{C}know it's long gone and it was ^{G}nothing else I could do \\
    And I ^{Am}forget about you long enough to ^{G}forget why I needed ^{F-G}to ^{Am-G}
  \end{prechorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    'Cause ^{C}here we are again in the ^{G}middle of the night.
    We ^{Am}dance around the kitchen in the re^{F}frigerator light \\
    Down the ^{C}stairs, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well ^{F} \\

    And ^{C}there we are again when ^{G}nobody had to know.
    You ^{Am}kept me like a secret, but I ^{F}kept you like an oath \\
    Sacred ^{C}prayer and we'd swear to re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well, ^{F} yeah
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{solo}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllllll}
      |_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |_{G} & |_{G} & |
    \end{tabular}
  \end{solo}

  \begin{bridge}
    Maybe we got ^{C}lost in translation maybe I ^{G}asked for too much \\
    But maybe this ^{Am}thing was a masterpiece 'til you ^{F}tore it all up \\
    Running ^{C}scared, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well ^{F} \\
    Hey, you ^{C}call me up again just to ^{G}break me like a promise,
    so ^{Am}casually cruel in the ^{F}name of being honest \\
    I'm a ^{C}crumpled up piece of paper ^{G}lyin' here
    'cause I remember it ^{Am}all, all, ^{F}all...
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{verse}
    They say ^{C}all's well that ends well, but ^{G}I'm in a new hell
    every ^{Am}time you double-^{F}cross my mind \\
    You said if ^{C}we had been closer in ^{G}age, maybe it would've been ^{Am}fine
    and that made me ^{F}want to die \\
    The ^{C}idea you had of me, who was she? A ^{G}never-needy, ever-lovely
    ^{Am}jewel whose shine reflects on ^{F}you \\
    Not ^{C}weepin' in a party bathroom, some ^{G}actress askin' me what happened,
    ^{Am}you, that's what happened, ^{F}you \\
    You who ^{C}charmed my dad with self-eff^{G}acing jokes,
    ^{Am}sippin' coffee like you're on a ^{F}late-night show \\
    But then he ^{C}watched me watch the front door all night, ^{G}willin' you to come \\
    And he said, "^{Am}It's s'posed to be fun ^{F}turning twenty-one" \instruction{hold for 4 more counts}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{interlude}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}
      |_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |
    \end{tabular}
  \end{interlude}

  \begin{verse}
    \instruction{quietly but build back up again}
    ^{C}Time won't fly it's like I'm ^{G}paralyzed by it.
    I'd like to ^{Am}be my old self again, but I'm ^{F}still tryin' to find it \\
    After ^{C}plaid shirt days and nights when you ^{G}made me your own,
    now you ^{Am}mail back my things and I ^{F}walk home alone
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    But you ^{C}keep my old scarf from that ^{G}very first week
    'cause it re^{Am}minds you of innocence, and it ^{F}smells like me \\
    You can't get ^{C}rid of it... 'cause you re^{G}member it all too ^{Am} well ^{F}yeah \\
    'Cause ^{C}there we are again when I ^{G}loved you so,
    ^{Am}back before you lost the one real ^{F}thing you've ever known \\
    It was ^{C}rare, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am} well ^{F} \\
    Wind in my ^{C}hair, you were there, you re^{G}member it all,
    down the ^{Am}stairs, you were there, you re^{F}member it all \\
    It was ^{C}rare, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am} well ^{F}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    And I was never good at ^{C}tellin' jokes, but the ^{Am}punchline goes
    "I'll get ^{F}older but your lovers ^{G}stay my age" \\
    From when your ^{C}Brooklyn broke my ^{Am}skin and bones
    I'm a ^{F}soldier who's returning ^{G}half her weight \\
    And did the ^{C}twin flame bruise paint ^{Am}you blue?
    Just be^{F}tween us, did the love affair ^{G}maim you too? \\
    'Cause in this ^{F}city's barren ^{F}cold I still remember the ^{G}first fall of ^{G}snow
    and how it glistened as it ^{F}fell, I re^{F}member it all too ^{C}well
  \end{verse}

  \begin{outro}
    ^{Am} Just be^{F}tween us, did the love affair ^{G}maim you all too ^{C}well? \\
    ^{Am} Just be^{F}tween us, do you re^{G}member it all too ^{C}well? \\
    ^{Am} Just be^{F}tween us, I re^{G}member it (Just between us) all too-- \\
    ^{C}Wind in my hair, I was ^{Am}there, I was there, (I was there)
    ^{F} Down the stairs, I was ^{G}there, I was there \\
    ^{C} Sacred prayer, I was ^{Am}there, I was there,
    ^{F} It was rare, you re^{G}member it all too-- \\
    ^{C}Wind in my hair, I was ^{Am}there, I was there, (Oh)
    ^{F} Down the stairs, I was ^{G}there, I was there (I was there) \\
    ^{C} Sacred prayer, I was ^{Am}there, I was there,
    ^{F} It was rare, you re^{G}member it (All too well) \\
    ^{C}Wind in my hair, I was ^{Am}there, I was there,
    ^{F} Down the stairs, I was ^{G}there, I was there \\
    ^{C} Sacred prayer, I was ^{Am}there, I was there,
    ^{F} It was rare, you re^{G}member it... \\

    \instruction{fade out} \\
    ^{C}Wind in my hair, I was ^{Am}there, I was there,
    ^{F} Down the stairs, I was ^{G}there, I was there \\
    ^{C} Sacred prayer, I was ^{Am}there, I was there,
    ^{F} It was rare, you re^{G}member it

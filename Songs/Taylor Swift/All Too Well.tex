\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
I ^{C}walked through the door with you, ^{G} the air was cold \\
But ^{Am}something 'bout it felt like ^{F}home somehow \\
And I ^{C}left my scarf there at your ^{G}sister's house \\
And you ^{Am}still got it, in your ^{F}drawer, even now
\end{verse}

\begin{interlude}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}
|_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |
\end{tabular}
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
Oh your ^{C}sweet disposition and my ^{G}wide eyed gaze \\
We're ^{Am}singing in the car getting ^{F}lost upstate \\
The ^{C}autumn leaves falling down like ^{G}pieces into place \\
And I ^{Am}can picture it after ^{F}all these days
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
And I ^{C}know it's long gone and that ^{G}magic’s not here no more \\
And I ^{Am}might be okay but I'm not... ^{G}fine at al^{F}l \hspace{10pt} ^{F-G}  
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause ^{C}there we are again on that ^{G}little town street \\ 
You ^{Am}almost ran the red 'cause you were ^{F}lookin' over at me \\
Wind in my ^{C}hair, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well ^{F}  
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Photo ^{C}album on the counter, your ^{G}cheeks were turning red \\
You used to be a ^{Am}little kid with glasses in a ^{F}twin size bed \\
And your ^{C}mother’s telling stories 'bout you on a ^{G}t-ball team \\
You ^{Am}taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your ^{F}future was me 
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
And I ^{C}know it's long gone and it was ^{G}nothing else I could do \\ 
And I ^{Am}forget about you long enough to ^{G}forget why I needed ^{F}to  ^{F-G} 
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause ^{C}here we are again in the ^{G}middle of the night \\
We ^{Am}dance around the kitchen in the re^{F}frigerator light \\
Down the ^{C}stairs, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well ^{F}
\end{chorus}

\begin{solo}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllllll}
|_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |_{G} & |_{G} & | 
\end{tabular}
\end{solo}

\begin{bridge}
Maybe we got ^{C}lost in translation maybe I ^{G}asked for too much \\
But maybe this ^{Am}thing was a masterpiece ‘til you ^{F}tore it all up \\  
Running ^{C}scared, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too ^{Am}well ^{F} \\
Hey, you ^{C}call me up again just to ^{G}break me like a promise \\
So ^{Am}casually cruel in the name ^{F}of being honest \\
I'm a crum^{C}pled up piece of paper lyin'^{G} here \\
'cause I remember it ^{Am}all, all, a^{F}ll… too w^{(C)}ell
\end{bridge}

\begin{interlude}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}
|_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |
\end{tabular}
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
^{C}Time won't fly it's like I'm ^{G}paralyzed by it \\
I'd like to ^{Am}be my old self again, but I'm ^{F}still tryin' to find it \\
After ^{C}plaid shirt days and nights when you ^{G}made me your own \\
Now you ^{Am}mail back my things and I ^{F}walk home alone
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
But you ^{C}keep my old scarf from that ^{G}very first week \\
'cause it re^{Am}minds you of innocence, and it ^{F}smells like me \\ 
You can’t get ^{C}rid of it... 'cause you ^{G}remember it all too w^{Am}ell ^{F}yeah \\ \\
'Cause ^{C}there we are again when I ^{G}loved you so \\
^{Am}Back before you lost the one real ^{F}thing you've ever known \\
It was ^{C}rare, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too^{Am} wel^{F}l 
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
Wind in my ^{C}hair, you were there, you re^{G}member it oh \\
Down the ^{Am}stairs, you were there, you re^{F}member it all \\
It was ^{C}rare, I was there, I re^{G}member it all too^{Am} we^{F}ll 
\end{outro}

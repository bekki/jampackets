\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{C} You booked the night train for a ^{G}reason \hspace{20pt}
So you could ^{Am}sit there in this ^{F}hurt \\
^{C} Bustling crowds or silent ^{G}sleepers \hspace{20pt} 
You're ^{Am}not sure which is ^{F}worse 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Because I ^{C} dropped your hand while dancing,  
^{G} left you out there standing ^{Am} crestfallen on the landing \\  
^{F}Champagne problems \\
^{C} Your mom's ring in your pocket, 
^{G} my picture in your wallet, ^{Am} your heart was glass, I dropped it \\ 
^{F}Champagne problems 
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}
|_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |
\end{tabular}
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
^{C} You told your family for a ^{G}reason \hspace{20pt}
You ^{Am}couldn't keep it ^{F}in \\
^{C} Your sister splashed out on the ^{G}bottle \hspace{20pt}
Now ^{Am}no one's celebr^{F}ating
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{C} Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it, 
^{G} No crowd of friends applauded, ^{Am} Your hometown skeptics called it \\ 
^{F}Champagne problems \\
^{C} You had a speech, you're speechless, 
^{G} Love slipped beyond your reaches ^{Am} and I couldn't give a reason \\  
^{F}Champagne problems
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllllllll}
|_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & |_{C} & |_{G} & |_{Am} & |_{F} & | 
\end{tabular}
\end{interlude}

\begin{bridge}
^{C} Your Midas touch on the Chevy ^{G}door \hspace{20pt}
November flush and your flannel ^{Am}cure \\ 
"This dorm was once a madhouse" I ^{F}made a joke, "Well, it's made for me" \\
How ^{C} evergreen, our group of ^{G}friends \hspace{20pt}
Don't think we'll say that word ^{Am}again \\
And soon they'll have the nerve to ^{F}deck the halls that we once walked through \\
^{C}One for the money, two for the show \hspace{20pt}
I ^{G}never was ready so I watch you go \\
Some^{Am}times you just don't know the answer \hspace{20pt}
'Til ^{F}someone's on their knees and asks you \\
"She ^{C}would've made such a lovely bride \hspace{20pt}
What a ^{G}shame she's fucked in the head," they said \\
But ^{Am}you'll find the real thing instead \hspace{20pt}
She'll ^{F}patch up your tapestry that I shred 
\end{bridge}

\begin{chorus}
^{C} And hold your hand while dancing, 
^{G} Never leave you standing ^{Am} crestfallen on the landing \\ 
^{F} with champagne problems \\
^{C}  Your mom's ring in your pocket, ^{G} Her picture in your wallet \\ 
^{Am} You won't remember all my ^{F}champagne problems 
\end{chorus}

\begin{outro}
^{C} \hspace{10pt} ^{G} \hspace{10pt} ^{Am} You won't remember all my ^{F}champagne problems \\
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}

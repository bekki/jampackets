\begin{verse}
^{Dmaj7} I sit and watch you reading ^{E}with your head low \\
^{Dmaj7} I wake and watch you breathing ^{E}with your eyes closed \\
^{Dmaj7} I sit and watch you... ^{E} I notice everything you ^{Dmaj7}do or don't do \\
You're so much older ^{E}and wiser, and I...
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus1}
^{A} Wait by the door like I'm just a ^{Dmaj7}kid, use my best colors for your ^{F#m}portrait \\
Lay the table with the fancy ^{E}shit and watch you tolerate ^{A}it \\
If it's all in my head tell me ^{Dmaj7}now, tell me I've got it wrong ^{F#m}somehow \\
I know my love should be cele^{E}brated but you tolerate ^{(1st time) Dmaj7 | (2nd time) F#m} it
\end{chorus1}

\begin{verse}
I greet you with a battle ^{E}hero's welcome, ^{Dmaj7} I take your indiscretions ^{E}all in good fun \\
^{Dmaj7} I sit and listen, ^{E}I polish plates until they ^{Dmaj7}gleam and glisten \\
You're so much older ^{E}and wiser and I...
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
While you were out building other worlds, ^{Dmaj7}where was I? \\
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my ^{F#m}barbed wire? \\
I made you my temple, my mural, my ^{E}sky... Now I'm begging for footnotes in the ^{F#m}story of your life \\
Drawing hearts in the byl^{Dmaj7}ine, always taking up too much space or ^{F#m}time \\
You assume I'm fine, but what would you ^{E}do if I...
\end{bridge}

\begin{chorus2}
^{A} Break free and leave us in ^{Dmaj7}ruins, took this dagger in me and re^{A}moved it \\
Gain the weight of you then ^{E}lose it, believe me I could ^{A}do it \\
If it's all in my head tell me ^{Dmaj7}now, tell me I've got it wrong some^{A}how \\
I know my love should be cele^{E}brated but you tolerate ^{F#m}it

^{Dmaj7} \hspace{10pt} ^{F#m} \hspace{10pt} ^{E} I sit and watch you

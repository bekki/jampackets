  \begin{verse}
    Draw the cat eye, sharp enough to kill a man ^{Am}   \\
    ^{Am} You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them ^{F}  \\
    ^{Am} Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie ^{Am} \\
    ^{Am} They say looks can kill and I might try ^{F}  \\
    I don't dress for ^{E}women, I don't dress for ^{E}men \\
    Lately I've been dressin' for re^{Am}venge
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{Am} I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ^{Am}ends. \hspace{20pt}
    ^{C-}Don't get sad, ^{G}get even \\
    ^{Am} So on the week^{E}ends I don't dress for ^{E}friends. \hspace{20pt}
    Lately I've been dressin' for re^{N.C.}venge
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} She needed cold hard proof, so I gave her some ^{Am} \\
    ^{Am} She had the envelope, where you think she got it from? ^{F}  \\
    ^{Am} Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride ^{Am} \\
    ^{Am} Picture me thick as thieves with your exwife ^{F}  \\
    And she looks so ^{E}pretty drivin' in your ^{E}Benz \\
    Lately she's been dressin' for re^{Am}venge
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{Am} She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ^{Am}ends. \hspace{20pt}
    ^{C-}Don't get sad, ^{G}get even ^{Am} \\
    So on the week^{E}ends she don't dress for ^{E}friends. \hspace{20pt}
    Lately she's been dressing for re^{Am*}venge
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{interlude}
    \instruction{beat only} \\
    Ladies always rise above, \hspace{20pt} Ladies know what people want \\
    Someone sweet and kind and fun, \hspace{20pt} The lady simply had enough
  \end{interlude}

  \begin{verse}
    Well, he was doin' ^{Am}lines and crossin' all of ^{Am}mine \\
    ^{Am} Someone told his white collar ^{Am}crimes to the FB^{F}I \\
    And I don't dress for ^{E}villains or for ^{E}innocents \\
    On my vigilante ^{Am}shit again
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{Am} I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ^{Am}ends. \hspace{20pt}
    ^{C-}Don't get sad, ^{G}get even^{Am} \\
    So on the week^{E}ends I don't dress for ^{E}friends. \hspace{20pt}
    Lately I've been dressin' for re^{N.C.}venge

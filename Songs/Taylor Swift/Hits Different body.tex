  ^{F} I washed ^{A#/F}my hands of ^{F}us ^{Fsus2}at the club,
  ^{F} you made ^{A#/F}a mess of ^{F}me   ^{Fsus2}      \\
  ^{F} I pict^{A#/F}ured you with ^{F}other ^{Fsus2}girls in love
    ^{F} then threw ^{A#/F}up on the ^{F}street  ^{Fsus2}  \\
  ^{F} Like wai^{A#/F}ting for a ^{F}bus  ^{Fsus2} that never shows
    ^{F} you just ^{A#/F}start walking ^{F}on   ^{Fsus2}  \\
  ^{F} They say ^{A#/F}that if it's ^{F}right, ^{Fsus2}you know \\
  ^{F} Each bar ^{A#/F} plays our ^{F}song, ^{Fsus2}nothing has ever felt so wrong

\begin{verse}
  ^{F} I used ^{A#/F}to switch out ^{F}these ^{Fsus2}Kens, I'd just ghost \\
  ^{F} Rip ^{A#/F}the band-aid ^{F}off and ^{Fsus2}skip town like an asshole outlaw \\
  ^{F} Free^{A#/F}dom felt like s^{F}ummer ^{Fsus2}then on the coast \\
  ^{F} Now ^{A#/F}the sun burns m^{F}y hea^{Fsus2}rt and the sand hurts my feelings \\
  ^{F} ^{A#/F}And I never don't ^{F}cry (^{Fsus2}And I never don't cry) at the bar \\
  ^{F} Yeah, ^{A#/F}my sadness ^{F}is cont^{Fsus2}agious (My sadness is contagious) \\
  ^{F} I slur ^{A#/F}your name 'til ^{F}someone ^{Fsus2}puts me in a car \\
  ^{F} I stopped ^{A#/F}receiving ^{F}invit- ^{Fsus2}ations

  ^{F}   I find ^{A#/F}the artifacts, ^{F}cried o^{Fsus2}ver a hat, cursed the space that I needed \\
  ^{F}   I trace ^{A#/F}the evidence, ^{F}make it ^{Fsus2}make some sense, why the wound is still bleeding \\
  ^{F}      You ^{A#/F}were the one that I ^{F}loved, don't ^{Fsus2}need another metaphor it's simple enough \\
  A ^{F}wrinkle in time ^{A#/F}like the crease by your ^{F}eyes,
  ^{Fsus2}this is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy \\
  ^{F}Dreams ^{A#/F} of ^{F}your hair ^{Fsus2}and your stare and sense of be^{F}lief \\
  ^{A#/F} In ^{F}the good ^{Fsus2}in the world, you once believed in ^{F}me \\
  ^{A#/F} And I^{F} felt ^{Fsus2}you and I held you for a ^{F}while \\
  Bet I ^{A#/F}could still melt your ^{F}world, ^{Fsus2}argumentative, antithetical dream girl

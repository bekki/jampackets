\begin{verse}
It's ^{C}coming on Christmas, they're cutting down trees\\
They're ^{C}putting up reindeer and singing songs of joy and peace\\
Oh I ^{Am}wish I had a river I could skate ^{G}away on\\
But ^{C}it don't snow here, it stays pretty green\\
I'm gonna ^{C}make a lot of money then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene\\
I ^{Am}wish I had a river I could skate ^{G}away on
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I ^{F}wish I had a river so ^{G}long I ^{C}would teach my feet to ^{F-Em-Dm}fly\\
Oh I ^{C}wish I had a river ^{G} I could skate ^{F}away on... 
I made my baby ^{(C)}cry
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
He ^{C}tried hard to help me, you know, he put me at ease\\
And he ^{C}loved me so naughty made me weak in the knees\\
Oh I ^{Am}wish I had a river I could skate ^{G}away on\\
I'm ^{C}so hard to handle, I'm selfish and I'm sad\\
Now I've ^{C}gone and lost the best baby that I ever had\\
Oh I ^{Am}wish I had a river I could skate ^{G}away on
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I ^{F}wish I had a river so ^{G}long I ^{C}would teach my feet to ^{F-Em-Dm}fly\\
Oh I ^{C}wish I had a river ^{G}I could skate ^{F}away on... 
I made my baby say ^{(C)}goodbye

    ^{G}There's a Black man with a black cat, livin' in a Black neighborhood \\

    And there's a ^{G}woman in the kitchen cleanin' up the evenin' slop \\
    And he ^{F}looks at her and says "Hey darlin', ^{C}I can remember when you could ^{G}stop a clock"
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}

    He's got ^{G}greasy hair, greasy smile, he says, "^{F-}Lord this must ^{C}be my destina^{G}tion" \\
    'Cause they ^{G}told me when I was younger, sayin' "boy you're gonna be president" \\
    But just like ^{F}everything else, those old ^{C}crazy dreams just kinda came and ^{G}went

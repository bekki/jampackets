    \begin{verse}
        ^{F#m}Harness your hopes on just one ^{A}person \hspace{20pt}
        Because you know a ^{F#m}harness was only made for ^{A}one \\
        Don't telegraph your ^{F#m}passes you'll end up with mo^{A}lasses \hspace{20pt}
        Cauterized in ^{F#m}syrup and syrup and mo^{A}lasses \\
        And I'm checking out the ^{B}asses, the assets that at^{D}tract us \\
        To anything that ^{F#m}moves, we're deep inside the ^{A}grooves \\
        And it's time to shake the ^{B}rations cause someone's gonna ^{D}cash in \\
        The plot it turns a^{F#m}gain, the reference starts at ^{A}ten
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
        Well ^{F#m}show me a word that rhymes with ^{A}Pavement \hspace{20pt}
        And I won't kill your ^{F#m}parents and roast them on a ^{A}spit \\
        And a-don't you try to ^{F#m}etch it or permanently ^{A}sketch it \hspace{20pt}
        Or you're gonna ^{F#m}catch a bad bad ^{A}cold \\
        And the freaks have stormed the ^{B}white house, I moved into a ^{D}lighthouse \\
        It's on a scenic ^{F#m}quay, it's oh so far a^{A}way \hspace{20pt}
        Far away from the be^{B}ginning, the shroud is made of ^{D}linen \\
        The yearling took the ^{F#m}purse, the goth kid has a ^{A}hearse
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
        ^{E}Heartbreaking, earthquaking, ^{E}Kiwis they are home baking \hspace{20pt}
        ^{D7-}Minds ^{A}wide ^{B-}o- ^{E}pen ^{D7-}tru- ^{A}ly
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
        ^{F#m}Leisure, a leisure suit is ^{A}nothing \hspace{20pt}
        It's nothing to be ^{F#m}proud of in this late centu^{A}ry \\
        And I'm asking you to ^{F#m}hold me just like the morning ^{A}paper \\
        Pinched between your ^{F#m}pointer, your index and your ^{A}thumb \hspace{20pt}
        It's a semiauto^{B}matic, believers are ecs^{D}tatic \\
        You see the way they ^{F#m}cling, the cold metallic ^{A}sting \hspace{20pt}
        And I'm living in a ^{B}coma for Donna de Va^{D}rona \\
        The harness made of ^{F#m}hopes, the lovers on the ^{A}ropes
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
        ^{E}Nun is to church as the ^{E}parrot is to perch \hspace{20pt}
        and my ^{D7-}heart's ^{A}wide ^{B-}o- ^{E}pen ^{D7-}tru- ^{A}ly
    \end{chorus}

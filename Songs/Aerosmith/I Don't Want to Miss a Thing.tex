  \begin{verse}
    I could ^{D}stay awake ^{Dsus2/C#}just to hear you ^{Bm}breathing \\
    Watch you ^{G}smile while you are ^{D/F#}sleeping while you're ^{Em}far away and dreaming \\
    I could ^{D}spend my life ^{Dsus2/C#}in this sweet ^{Bm}surrender. I could ^{G}stay lost in this ^{D/F#}moment ^{Em}forever \\
    Every moment ^{F#m}spent with ^{G}you is a moment I ^{Asus4-A}treasure
  \end{verse}

    ^{D}I don't wanna ^{Dsus2/C#}close my eyes, ^{Em}I don't wanna fall asleep \\
    Cause I'd ^{G}miss you baby and I don't wanna ^{A}miss a ^{D}thing \\
    Cause even when I ^{Dsus2/C#}dream of you ^{Em}the sweetest dream would never do \\
    I'd still ^{G}miss you baby and I don't wanna ^{A}miss a ^{D-Dsus2/C#}thing ^{Em*}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    Lying ^{D}close to you, ^{Dsus2/C#}feeling your heart ^{Bm}beating \\
    And I'm ^{G}wondering what you're ^{D/F#}dreaming, wondering ^{Em}if it's me you're seeing \\
    Then I ^{D}kiss your eyes and ^{Dsus2/C#}thank God we're ^{Bm}together \\
    I just wanna ^{Esus4}stay with you ^{Bm7/F#}in this moment for^{Asus4-A}ever, forever and ever

    And I don't wanna ^{C}miss one smile, I don't wanna ^{G/B}miss one kiss \\
    Well, I just wanna ^{Bb}be with you, right here with you ^{F/A}just like this \\

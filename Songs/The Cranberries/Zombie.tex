    ^{Em}Another ^{C}head hangs lowly, ^{G}child is slowly ^{D/F#}taken \\
    ^{Em}And the violence ^{C}caused such silence, ^{G}who are we mista^{D/F#}ken  \\
    But you ^{Em}see it's not me, it's not ^{C}my family \hspace{10pt}
    In your ^{G}head, in your head, they are ^{D/F#}fighting \\
    With their ^{Em}tanks and their bombs and their ^{C}bombs and their guns \hspace{10pt}
    In your ^{G}head, in your head, they are ^{D/F#}crying

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Em}Another ^{C}mother's breaking ^{G}heart is taking ^{D/F#}over  \\
    ^{Em}When the violence ^{C}causes silence, ^{G}we must be mi^{D/F#}staken \\
    It's the ^{Em}same old theme since ^{C}1916 \hspace{10pt}
    In your ^{G}head, in your head, they're still ^{D/F#}fighting \\
    With their ^{Em}tanks and their bombs and their ^{C}bombs and their guns \hspace{10pt}
    In your ^{G}head, in your head, they are ^{D/F#}dying

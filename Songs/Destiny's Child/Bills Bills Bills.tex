\begin{verse}
^{Bm} At first we started out real ^{F#}cool, ^{Bm} taking me places I ain't ^{F#}never been \\
But now, ^{Em}you're getting comfortable, ain't ^{F#}doing those things you did no more \\
You're ^{Em}slowly making me pay for things your ^{F#}money should be handling
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{Bm} And now you ask to use my ^{F#}car (car). ^{Bm} Drive it all day and don't fill ^{F#}up the tank \\
And you ^{Em}have the audacity to ^{F#}even come and step to me \\
^{Em}Ask to hold some money from me un^{F#}til you get your check next week
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
^{Bm} You triflin', ^{F#}good-for-nothing type of brother. ^{Bm} Silly me, why ^{F#}haven't I found another? \\
^{Em} A baller, when times get ^{F#}hard I need someone to help me out \\
^{Em} Instead of a scrub like ^{F#}you, who don't know what a man's about
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus} \instruction{play 2x} \\
^{Bm}Can you pay my bills? 
Can you ^{F#m}pay my telephone bills? 
Do you ^{A}pay my automo' bills? \\
If you ^{E}did then maybe we could chill. 
^{G}I don't think you ^{G}do, \hspace{10pt}
so, ^{F#}you and me are ^{F#}through
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Bm} Now you've been maxing out my ^{F#}card (card) 
^{Bm} Gave me bad credit, buyin' me ^{F#}gifts with my own ends \\
^{Em} Haven't paid the first bill but you're ^{F#}steady headin' to the mall \\
Goin' on ^{Em}shopping sprees perpetrating to your ^{F#}friends like you be ballin'
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{Bm} And then you use my ^{F#}cellphone (phone) 
^{Bm} callin' whoever that you ^{F#}think's at home \\
And ^{Em}then when the bill comes all of a ^{F#}sudden you be acting dumb \\
Don't ^{Em}know where none of these calls come from 
when your ^{F#}momma's number
s here more than once
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
^{Bm} You triflin', ^{F#}good-for-nothing type of brother. ^{Bm} Silly me, why ^{F#}haven't I found another? \\
^{Em} A baller, when times get ^{F#}hard I need someone to help me out \\
^{Em} Instead of a scrub like ^{F#}you, who don't know what a man's about

^{Bm} You triflin', ^{A}good-for-nothing type of brother. 
^{Bm} Oh silly me, why ^{A}haven't I found another?
\end{bridge}

\begin{chorus}
^{Bm}Can you pay my bills? 
Can you ^{F#m}pay my telephone bills? 
Do you ^{A}pay my automo' bills? \\

\begin{verse}
Yeah, I'm out that ^{F#}Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca \\
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever \\
I'm the new Si^{B}natra, and since I made it here \\\
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere \\
I used to cop in ^{F#}Harlem hola, my Dominicanos \\
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's \\
Took it to my ^{B}stash spot, 560 State Street \\
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry \\
Cruisin' down ^{F#}8th Street, off-white Lexus \\
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas \\
Me? I'm out that ^{B}Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie \\
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me \\
Say what up to ^{F#}Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais \\
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
Yo, I be ^{A#m}spiked out, I could trip a referee \\
Tell by my attitude that I'm most defi(nitely from)
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
In New ^{B}York Concrete jungle where dreams are ^{F#}made of \\
There's nothin' you ^{C#}can't do now you're in New ^{B}York \\
These streets will make you feel ^{F#}brand-new, big lights will in^{C#}spire you \\
Let's hear it for New ^{B}York, New York, New York
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Catch me at the ^{F#}X with OG at a Yankee game \\
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can \\
You should know I ^{B}bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though \\
But I got a gang of fellas walkin' with my clique though \\
Welcome to the ^{F#}meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock \\
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop \\
Yellow cab, ^{B}gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back \\
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add \\
Eight million ^{F#}stories out there in the naked \\
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it \\
Me? I gotta ^{B}plug Special Ed, "I Got It Made" \\
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade \\
Three dice ^{F#}cee-lo, three-card Marley \\
Labor Day Parade rest in peace, Bob Marley
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
Statue of ^{A#m}Liberty, long live the World Trade \\
Long live the king, yo I'm from the Empire St(ate, that's)
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
In New ^{B}York Concrete jungle where dreams are ^{F#}made of \\
There's nothin' you ^{C#}can't do now you're in New ^{B}York \\

\begin{verse}
^{F#}Lights is blinding, girls need blinders \\
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is \\
^{B}Lined with casualties who sip the life casually \\
Then gradually become worse don't bite the apple, Eve! \\
^{F#}Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style \\
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out \\
^{B}City of sin is a pity on a whim \\
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them \\
^{F#}Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out \\
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route \\
^{B} "Hail Mary" to the city, you're a virgin \\
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end \\
^{F#}Came here for school, graduated to the high life \\
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
\end{verse}

\begin{prechorus}
^{A#m}MDMA got you feelin' like a champion \\
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien    
\end{prechorus}

\begin{chorus}
In New ^{B}York Concrete jungle where dreams are ^{F#}made of \\
There's nothin' you ^{C#}can't do now you're in New ^{B}York \\

\begin{interlude}
^{B} One hand in the air for the big city \\
^{B} Street lights, big dreams, all lookin' pretty \\

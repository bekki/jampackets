Well ^{D#}sometimes I go out by myself and I look across the ^{Fm}water \\
And I ^{D#}think of all the things, what you're doing and in my head I paint a ^{Fm}picture

\begin{chorus}
'Cos ^{G#}since I've come on home, well my ^{Gm}body's been a mess \\
And I've ^{G#}missed your ginger hair and the ^{Gm}way you like to dress \\
^{G#}Won't you come on over, ^{Gm}stop making a fool out of ^{A#}me   \\
Why don't you come on over Va-a-ler-^{D#}ie, Valerie-^{Fm}-e-ee, Va-a-a-^{D#}lerie, Valerie-^{Fm}e-ee
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Did you ^{D#}have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, did you get a good ^{Fm}lawyer \\
I hope you ^{D#}didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man who'll fix it for ^{Fm}ya \\
Are you ^{D#}shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, ^{Fm}are you busy? \\
And did you ^{D#}have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time are you still ^{Fm}dizzy, still dizzy?

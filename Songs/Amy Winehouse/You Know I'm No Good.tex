\begin{verse}
^{Dm}Meet you downstairs in the ^{Gm}bar and hurt \hspace{10pt} 
Your ^{A}rolled up sleeves in your ^{Dm}skull t-shirt \\
You say, ^{Dm}"What did you do with ^{Gm}him today?" \hspace{10pt}  
And ^{A}sniff me out like I was ^{Dm}Tanqueray \\ 
^{Gm} 'Cos you're my fella, my guy \hspace{10pt}  
^{E7} Hand me your Stella and fly \\
^{F} By the time I'm out the door \hspace{10pt} 
You ^{E7}tear men down like ^{A}Roger Moore 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Dm} I cheated myself, ^{Am} like I ^{E7}knew I ^{Am}would \hspace{10pt}  
I ^{Dm}told ya I was ^{Am}trouble \hspace{10pt} 
You ^{E7}know that I'm no ^{Am}good
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Dm} Upstairs in bed with ^{Gm}my ex boy \hspace{10pt}  
^{A} He's in the place but I ^{Dm}can’t get joy \\
^{Dm} Thinking of you in the ^{Gm}final throes \hspace{10pt} 
^{A} This is when my ^{Dm}buzzer goes \\
^{Gm} Run out to meet you, chips and pita \hspace{10pt}  
^{E7} You say, "When we marry?" 'Cos you're not bitter \\
^{F} "There'll be none of him no more" \hspace{10pt} 
I ^{E7}cried for you on the ^{A}kitchen floor

^{Dm} Sweet reunion, Ja^{Gm}maica and Spain \hspace{10pt} 
^{A} We're like how we ^{Dm}were again \\
^{Dm} I'm in the tub, you’^{Gm}re on the seat \hspace{10pt} 
^{A} Lick your lips as I ^{Dm}soak my feet \\ 
^{Gm} Then you notice lickle carpet burn \hspace{10pt} 
^{E7} My stomach drop and my guts churn \\ 
^{F} You shrug and it's the worst to ^{E7}truly stick the ^{A}knife in first

\begin{intro}
_{B} 
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{B}Whoa, I hear the ^{B}quiet now of ^{F#m}paper airplanes falling ^{B}down \\
^{B}Whoa, the branches of ^{B}every tree ^{F#m}bend like a cathedral over ^{B}me
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Gmaj7}Down where the river bends, everyone's ^{F#7}waiting \\
But that's not the ^{Gmaj7}reason I'm making these tracks in the ^{E7}snow \\
There's a ^{D*-}box in my ^{C*-}hands as I ^{G*}go, 
^{D*-}wrapped up in ^{C*-}scarlet and ^{G*}gold... ^{G*-} For ^{B}you ^{B}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
^{B}Whoa, there's a ^{B}choir upon the wind ^{F#m}singing old familiar ^{B}hymns \\
And ^{B}my ears they're playing ^{B}tricks on me, I can ^{F#m}almost hear harm^{B}ony
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{Gmaj7}Down where the river bends, that's where you're ^{F#7}waiting, \\
You are the ^{Gmaj7}reason I'm making these tracks in the ^{E7}snow  \\
There's a ^{D*-}box in my ^{C*-}hands as I ^{G*}go, 
^{D*-}wrapped up in ^{C*-}scarlet and ^{G*}gold... ^{G*-} \\
For ^{B}you, ^{B} for ^{(F#m)}you
\end{chorus}

\begin{solo}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}lllll}
|_{F#m} & |_{B} & | _{B} & | _{B} & | \\
|_{F#m} & |_{B} & |
\end{tabular}
\end{solo}

\begin{outro}
^{Gmaj7}Down where the river bends, nobody's ^{F#7}waiting \\
But there's still a ^{Gmaj7}reason for making these tracks in the ^{E7}snow \\
^{D*-}Down at the ^{C*-}end of the ^{G*}road \\
^{D*-}I'll clear a ^{C*-}place in the ^{G*}snow \\
Leave this ^{D*-}box wrapped in ^{C*-}scarlet and ^{G*}gold... \\
^{G*-} For ^{B}you, for you...

\begin{intro}
_{E}
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
When I was ^{E}young I'd listen to the ^{G#m/D#}radio waiting ^{C#m}for my favorite ^{C#m/B}songs \\
When they ^{Amaj7}played I'd sing a^{G#m7}long - it made me ^{F#m7}smile \hspace{20pt} ^{B-A/B} \\
Those were such ^{E}happy times and not so ^{G#m/D#}long ago, how I ^{C#m-}wondered ^{C#m/B}where they'd ^{Amaj7}gone \\
^{D#m7b5*-}But ^{G#7*-}they're ^{C#m}back again just like a ^{C#m/B}long lost friend, 
all the ^{Amaj7-}songs I ^{F#m7}love so ^{B}well 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Every ^{E}sha-la-la-la, every ^{C#m}wo-o-wo-o still ^{E}shines  ^{C#m}    \\
Every ^{E}shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're s^{C#m}tartin' to sing so ^{F#m7}fine   ^{B}  \\
When they ^{C#m}get to the part where he's ^{Caug}breaking her heart \\
It can ^{E/B}really make me ^{A#m7b5*}cry, just like be^{E/B}fore, ^{A/B}It's yesterday once ^{(Emaj7)}more
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
^{Emaj7} (Shoobidoo-lang-^{A/B}lang, ^{Emaj7} Shoobidoo-lang-^{A/B}lang)
\end{interlude}

\begin{verse}
Looking ^{E}back on how it was in ^{G#m/D#}years gone by and the ^{C#m}good times that I ^{C#m/B}had \\
Makes to^{Amaj7}day seem rather ^{G#m7}sad, so much has ^{F#m7}changed \hspace{10pt} ^{A/B-B} \\ 
It was ^{E}songs of love that I would ^{G#m/D#}sing to then and I'd ^{C#m-}mem- o^{C#m/B}rize each ^{Amaj7}word  \\
^{D#m7b5*-}Those ^{G#7*-}old ^{C#m}melodies still sound so ^{C#m/B}good to me as they ^{Amaj7-}melt the ^{F#m7}years a^{A/B}way
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Every ^{E}sha-la-la-la, every ^{C#m}wo-o-wo-o still sh^{E}ines (All the oldies but ^{C#m}goodies)   \\
Every ^{E}shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're s^{C#m}tartin' to sing so ^{F#m7}fine   ^{B}  \\
All my ^{C#m}best memories come back ^{Caug}clearly to me, some can ^{E/B}even make me ^{A#m7b5*}cry \\
Just like be^{E/B}fore, ^{A/B}It's yesterday once ^{(Emaj7)}more
\end{chorus}

\begin{interlude}
^{Emaj7} (Shoobidoo-lang-^{A/B}lang)
\end{interlude}

\begin{outro}
Every ^{E}sha-la-la-la, every ^{C#m}wo-o-wo-o still ^{E}shines    ^{C#m}    \\
Every ^{E}shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're s^{C#m}tartin' to sing so ^{F#m7}fine   ^{B}  \\
\instruction{repeat and fade}

\begin{intro}
\begin{tabular}[t]{@{}llllll}
   |_{Am} & |_{C} & |_{Am} & |_{C} & |  
\end{tabular} \\
^{Am}The distant future, ^{C}the year 2000... 
^{Am}The distant future, the year 2000... 
^{C}The distant future, the distant future
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{Am}It is the distant future, the year 2000 (We are robots) \\
The world is quite different ever since the robotic uprising of the late nineties \\
There is no more unhappiness (Affirmative) \\
We no longer say yes, instead we say affirmative (Yes, affir-affirmative) \\
Unless we know the other robot really well \\
(There is no more unethical treatment of the elephants) \\
Well, there's no more elephants, so (ah), but still it's good \\
There's only one kind of dance, the robot (And the robo-boogie) \\
Oh and the ro, two kind of dances (But there are no more humans) \\
^{Am*}Finally ^{N.C.}robotic beings rule the world
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
The humans are ^{Am}dead, the humans are ^{Dm}dead \\
We used poisonous ^{C}gasses and we poisoned their ^{Dm}asses \\
The humans are ^{Am}dead (The humans are dead) \\
The humans are ^{Dm}dead (They look like they're dead) \\
It had to be ^{C}done (I'll just confirm that they're dead) \\
So that we could have ^{Dm*}fun (^{N.C.}Affirmative, I poked one, it was dead)
\end{chorus}

\begin{postchorus}
Their ^{F}system of oppression (^{G}what did it lead to?)
Global ^{Dm}robo-depression (ro^{C}bots ruled by people) \\
They had ^{F}so much aggression that we ^{G}just had to kill them, 
had to ^{F}shut their systems ^{E7}down
\end{postchorus}

\begin{verse}
^{Am}Robo captain, do you not realize that by destroying the human race because of their destructive tendencies \\
We too have become like, well it's ironic (Hm...) because we... (Silence, destroy him!) \instruction{*laser sounds*}   
\end{verse}

\begin{postchorus}
After ^{F}time we grew strong, (developed ^{G}cognitive powers) \\
They made us ^{Dm}work for too long (for un^{C}reasonable hours) \\
Our ^{F}program being determined that the ^{G}most efficient answer was to \\
^{F}shut their motherboard fucking ^{E7}systems down.........
\end{postchorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{Dm}Can't we just ^{G}talk to the humans? A ^{C}little understanding could ^{F}make things better \\
^{Bb}Can't we talk to the humans and work together, ^{E7}no? (No, ^{N.C.}because they are dead)
\end{bridge}

\begin{chorus}
I said the humans are ^{Am}dead (I'm glad they are dead) \\
The humans are ^{Dm}dead (I noticed they're dead) \\
We used poisonous ^{C}gasses (with traces of lead) \\
And we poisoned their ^{Dm}asses (actually their lungs, binary solo!)
\end{chorus}

\begin{solo}
^{Am*}0000001, ^{Dm*}00000011, ^{C*}000000111, ^{Dm*}00001111 \\
^{Am}0000001 (Oh, oh!) ^{Dm}00000011 (Oh, one!) ^{C}000000111 (One, oh!) ^{Dm*}C'mon ^{N.C.}sucker lick my battery
\end{solo}

\begin{outro}
   ^{Am}Boogie, ^{Dm}boogie, (The humans are) ^{C}Boogie, ^{Dm}robo boogie, (The humans are) \\
   ^{Am}Boogie, ^{Dm}boogie, (Robo boogie) ^{C}Boogie, ^{Dm}robo boogie \\
    
   ^{Am}Boogie, ^{Dm}boogie, (The humans are) ^{C}Boogie, ^{Dm}robo boogie, (The humans are) \\
   ^{Am}Boogie, ^{Dm}boogie, (Robo boogie) ^{C}Boogie, ^{Dm}robo boogie (The humans are ^{Am*}dead) \\
    
   ^{N.C.}Once again without emotion, the humans are ^{Am}dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dea...

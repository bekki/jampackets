  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am-} I live my ^{C}life in these four ^{F}walls \\
    ^{Am-} Head full of ^{C}dreams but I'm afr^{F}aid to tell them all \\
    ^{Dm} I climb a staircase and ^{G}carry all the dead weight \\
    Just to ^{Am-}fall, fall, ^{C}fall, fall, ^{F}fall
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am-} There is a ^{C}box, I keep it ^{F}closed \\
    ^{Am-} All full of ^{C}ashes from the ^{F}letters that I wrote \\
    ^{Dm} Maybe tomorrow, ^{G}pills I couldn't swallow \\
    They'll seem ^{Am-}small, small, ^{C}small, small, ^{F}small...  ^{Am-C}ahh- \hspace{10pt} ^{F}ahh
  \end{verse}

  \begin{bridge}
    ^{Em} Sometimes I feel like a ^{A#}raindrop in the ocean \\
    ^{Em} Fell from the sky, ^{Gm}melting into nothing \\
    Don't know ^{G}why \hspace{10pt} ^{G}
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am-} Last night I ^{C}wrote my own eulo^{F}gy \\
    ^{Am-} Here lies the ^{C}girl who never ^{F}let herself be free \\
    ^{Dm} Ain't it ironic, the ^{G}first time I was honest \\
    I was ^{Am-}gone, gone, ^{C}gone, gone, ^{F}gone
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am-} I'm not ^{C}one to wear my ^{F}heart out on my sleeve \\
    ^{Am-} But here I ^{C}am, will you ^{F} take all of me? \\
    Thought ^{Dm}love was for the perfect, ^{G}that I don't deserve it \\
    I was ^{Am-}wrong, wrong, ^{C}wrong, wrong, ^{F}wrong... ^{Am-C}ahh- \hspace{10pt} ^{F*}ahh
  \end{verse}

^{Fm} I was five and he was six, we rode on^{Eaug} horses ^{Fm/Eb}made of sticks \\
^{Eb} He wore black and I wore white, ^{C} he would always win the fight \\
Bang ba^{Fm}ng, he shot me down, Bang ba^{Fm}ng, I hit the ground \\
Bang ba^{Eb}ng, that awful sound, Bang ba^{C7}ng, my baby shot me down^{Fm}   ^{Bbm}    ^{C} 
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{Fm} Seasons came and ch^{Eaug}anged the time, ^{Fm/Eb} when I grew up I ^{Dm7b5}called him mine \\
^{Eb} He would always laugh and say, "R^{C}emember when we used to play?" \\
Bang ba^{Fm}ng, I shot you down, Bang ba^{Fm}ng, you hit the ground \\

^{Fm} Now he's gone, I don't^{Eaug} know why and ^{Fm/Eb}'til this day, some^{Dm7b5}times I cry \\

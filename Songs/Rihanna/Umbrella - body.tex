You ^{F#maj7}have my heart, and we'll never be ^{C#}worlds apart \\
Maybe in ^{Fm}magazines, but you'll still ^{A#m}be my star \\

And that's when you ^{Fm}need me there, with you I'll ^{A#m}always share
\end{verse}

Because ^{F#}when the sun shines, we'll shine tog^{C#}ether \\
Told you I'll be here for^{G#}ever, said I'll always be your ^{A#m}friend \\
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the ^{F#}end \\
Now that it's raining more than ^{C#}ever know that we'll still have each ^{G#}other \\
You can stand under my umbre^{A#m}lla, 
you can stand under my umbr^{F#}ella, ella, ella, eh, e^{C#}h, eh \\
Under my umbr^{Fm}ella, ella, ella, eh ^{A#m}eh, eh \\

These ^{F#maj7}fancy things, will never come ^{C#}in between \\
You're part of my ^{Fm}entity, here for in^{A#m}finity \\

If the ^{Fm}hand is hard, together we'll ^{A#m}mend your heart

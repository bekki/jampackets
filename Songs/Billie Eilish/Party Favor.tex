  \begin{verse}
    ^{C}Hey, call me back when you ^{Am}get this \\
    Or when you've got a ^{F}minute, we really need to ^{C-}talk ^{G}  \\
    ^{C}Wait, you know what, maybe just for^{Am}get it \\
    'Cause by the time you ^{F}get this your number might be ^{C-}blocked ^{G}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{prechorus}
    ^{Am}Stay and blah blah ^{C}blah. You just ^{F}want what you can't have ^{C-} \hspace{10pt} ^{G}  \\
    No ^{Am}way, I'll call the ^{C}cops. If you don't ^{F}stop I'll call your dad ^{C-} \hspace{10pt} ^{G}
  \end{prechorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    And I ^{F-}hate to do this ^{G}to you on your ^{C}birthday...
    happy ^{Am}birthday by the ^{E}way \\
    It's not ^{F-}you, it's me and ^{G}all that other ^{C}bullshit...
    You know that's ^{Am}bullshit, don't you ^{E}babe? \\
    ^{F*-} I'm not your ^{Fm*}party favor ^{C}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{C}Look, now I know we could've done it ^{Am}better \\
    But we can't change the ^{F}weather and the weather's come and ^{C-}gone ^{G}  \\
    ^{C}Books don't make sense if you read them ^{Am}backwards \\
    You'll single out the ^{F}wrong words like you mishear all my ^{C-}songs ^{G}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{prechorus}
    You'll hear ^{Am*}stay and blah blah ^{C}blah. You just ^{F}want what you can't have ^{C-} \hspace{10pt} ^{G}  \\
    No ^{Am*}way, I'll call the ^{C}cops. If you don't ^{F}stop I'll call your dad ^{C-} \hspace{10pt} ^{G}
  \end{prechorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    And I ^{F-}hate to do this ^{G}to you on your ^{C}birthday...
    happy ^{Am}birthday by the ^{E}way \\
    It's not ^{F-}you, it's me and ^{G}all that other ^{C}bullshit...
    You know that's ^{Am}bullshit, don't you ^{E}babe? \\
    ^{F*-} I'm not your ^{Fm*}party favor

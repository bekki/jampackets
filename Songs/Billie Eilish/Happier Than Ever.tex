\begin{intro}
_{G-G7*}
\end{intro}

\begin{chorus}
^{N.C.}When I'm ^{Cadd9}away from you, I'm happier than ^{E7}ever. 
Wish I could explain it ^{Am}better, I wish it wasn't ^{Dm7-}true, ^{G}mmm \\
Give me a ^{Cadd9}day or two to think of something ^{E7}clever, 
to write myself a ^{Am}letter to tell me what to ^{Dm7-}do, ^{G}mmm
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Do ^{C}you read my interviews or ^{E7}do you skip my avenue? \\ 
When ^{Am}you said you were passin' through, was I ^{Dm7b5}even on your way? \\
I ^{C}knew when I asked you to be ^{E7}cool about what I was tellin' you \\
You'd ^{Am}do the opposite of what you said you'd do and I'd ^{Dm7b5}end up more afraid \\
Don't say it is^{E7}n't fair, you clearly weren't aware that you ^{Am}made me ^{Am/G}miserab- ^{D/F#}le, ooh... \\
So if you ^{Dm7-}really wanna ^{G7}know
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{N.C.}When I'm ^{Cadd9}away from you, I'm happier than ^{E7}ever. 
Wish I could explain it ^{Am}better, I wish it wasn't ^{Dm7-}true, ^{G}mmm ^{C}

\begin{verse}
^{C}You called me a^{E7}gain, drunk in your ^{Am}Benz, drivin' home ^{F-}under the ^{Fm}influence \\
^{C}You scared me to ^{E7}death but I'm wastin' my ^{Am}breath, cause you only ^{F-}listen to ^{Fm}your fuckin' ^{(C)}(friends) \\
^{C}I don't relate to you ^{E7} \hspace{10pt} ^{Am}I don't relate to you, ^{F-Fm}no \\
'Cause I'd never ^{C}treat me this shitty, ^{E7} you made me ^{Am}hate this city ^{F-Fm} 
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
And I don't talk ^{C}shit about you on the ^{E7}internet, never told ^{Am}anyone anything ^{F-Fm}bad \\
'Cause that shit's em^{C}barrassing, you were my ^{E7}everything and all that you ^{Am}did was make me fuckin' ^{F-Fm}sad \\
So ^{C}don't waste the time I don't ^{E7}have and ^{Am}don't try to make me feel ^{F-Fm}bad \\
I could talk about ^{C}every time that you showed ^{E7}up on time but I'd have an ^{Am}empty line 'cause you never ^{F-Fm}did \\
Never paid any ^{C}mind to my mother or ^{E7}friends, so I shut them all ^{Am}out for you 'cause I was a ^{F-Fm}kid \\
^{C}You ruined everything ^{E7}good, always ^{Am}said you were misunderst^{F-Fm}ood \\
^{C}Made all my moments your ^{E7}own... ^{Am}Just fuckin' leave me a^{F-Fm}lone

    When we all ^{D}fall asleep where do we ^{N.C.}go?
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Gm} Say it, spit it out, ^{N.C.}what is it exactly? \\
    ^{Gm} You're payin'? Is the amount ^{Gm}cleaning you out, am I satisfactory? \\
    ^{Gm} Today I'm thinking about ^{Gm} the things that are deadly \\
    ^{Gm} The way I'm drinking you down ^{Gm}like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Gm} Keep you in the dark, ^{N.C.} what, had you expected? \\
    ^{Gm} Me to make you my art and ^{Gm}make you a star and get you connected? \\
    ^{Gm} I'll meet you in the park, ^{Gm} I'll be calm and collected \\
    ^{Gm} But we knew right from the start ^{Gm}that you'd fall apart cause I'm too expensive
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Gm} Your talk'll be something that shouldn't be ^{N.C.}said out loud \\

    ^{Gm} Bury the hatchet or bury your ^{N.C.}friend right now
  \end{verse}

  \begin{bridge}
    The ^{Gm}debt I owe, gotta ^{Cm}sell my soul
    'cause I ^{D}can't say no, no, I ^{Gm}can't say no \\

    and I ^{D}can't say no, I ^{Gm}can't say no

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Cmaj7}Don't be that way, fall a^{Gmaj7}part twice a day \\
    I just ^{Am}wish you could feel what you ^{Gmaj7}say  \\
    ^{Cmaj7}Show, never tell, but I ^{Gmaj7}know you too well \\
    Kind of ^{Am}mood that you wish you could ^{Dsus2-D}sell
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    If ^{Cmaj7}teardrops could be bottled
    there'd be ^{Gmaj7}swimming pools filled by models \\
    Told that t^{Am}ight dress is what makes you a w^{B7}hore \\
    If "I ^{Cmaj7}love you" was a promise,
    would you ^{Gmaj7}break it, if you're honest \\
    Tell the ^{Am}mirror what you know she's heard be^{D-Dsus2-D-Dsus2}fore \\
    ^{Cmaj7}I don't wanna ^{B7}be you anym^{Em}ore
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Cmaj7}Hands getting cold,
    losing ^{Gmaj7}feeling's getting old \\
    Was I ^{Am}made from a brok^{Gmaj7}en mold? \\
    ^{Cmaj7}Hurt I can't shake,
    We've made ^{Gmaj7}every mistake \\
    Only ^{Am}you know the way that I br^{Dsus2}eak    ^{D}  \\
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    If ^{Cmaj7}teardrops could be bottled

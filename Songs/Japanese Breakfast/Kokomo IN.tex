  \begin{intro}
    ^{Amaj7} If I could throw my ^{Bm}arms around you ^{Dm} for just another ^{Amaj7-}day \\
    ^{F#m}Maybe it'd ^{Bm-}feel ^{Dm}like the ^{Amaj7}first time \\
    Now that you're ^{C#m}away, I'll just ^{Bm-}spend my ^{Dm}life not ^{Amaj7}knowing
    ^{C#m}how it'd ^{Bm}feel... ^{Dm}to... ^{Dm}
  \end{intro}

  \begin{verse}
    These ^{A}days I can't shake the ^{C#m}awful feeling
    I'm ^{F#m}missing something I can't ^{A}place \\
    Is that ^{Bm}you, manifesting ^{C#m}like the fear of an ^{E}oven left on \\
    ^{E--D-A} ^{E} God, I felt so ^{Bm}much back then, I was ^{Dm}soft as a dune ^{Dm}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{A} If ever you ^{E}come back, ^{Bm} wherever you ^{D}find your way to \\
    ^{A} And though it may ^{E}not last, ^{Bm} just know that I'll ^{D}be here longing
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{solo}
    \begin{tabular}[t]{@{}llllll}
      |_{A} & |_{E} & |_{Bm} & |_{D} & | \\
      |_{A} & |_{E} & |_{Bm} & |_{D} & |
    \end{tabular}
  \end{solo}

  \begin{verse}
    I'll ^{A}wait, passing time just ^{C#m}popping wheelies
    and ^{F#m}kicking round this flyover ^{A}state \\
    Watching ^{Bm}you show off to the ^{C#m}world the parts I fell ^{E}so hard for \\
    ^{E--D-A} ^{E} God, I wish we could ^{Bm}go back there, left ^{Dm}alone in my room \\
    ^{A} I know they de^{C#m}serve you ^{Bm}too and maybe I'm ^{Dm}not that worthy ^{Dm}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{A} If ever you ^{E}come back, ^{Bm} wherever you ^{D}find your way to \\
    ^{A} And though it may ^{E}not last ^{Bm} just know that I'll b^{D}e here longing \\
    ^{A} If ever you ^{E}come back ^{Bm} wherever you ^{D}find your way to \\
    ^{A} And though it may ^{E}not last ^{Bm} just know that I'll b^{D}e here always
  \end{chorus}

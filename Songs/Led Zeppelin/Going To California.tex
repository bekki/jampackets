\begin{verse}
^{G}Spent my days with a woman unkind \hspace{10pt} 
Smoked my stuff and drank ^{D}all my wine \\
^{G}Made up my mind to make a new start \hspace{10pt}  
Going to California with an aching ^{D}in my heart \\
^{G}Someone told me theres a girl out there \hspace{10pt} 
With love in her eyes and flowers ^{D}in her hair
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
^{G}Took my chances on a big jet plane \hspace{10pt} 
Never let them tell you that they're all ^{D}the same \\ 
^{G}The sea was red and the sky was grey \hspace{10pt} 
Wondered how tomorrow could ever fol^{D}low today \\
The ^{G}Mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake \hspace{10pt}  
As the children of the sun began ^{D}to awake
\end{verse}

\begin{bridge}
^{Dm}Seems that the wrath of the gods got a punch on the nose and it started to flow, 
I think I might be si^{A7}nk- in^{A}g \\
^{Dm}Throw me a line if I reach it in time I'll meet you up there where the path 
Runs straight and ^{A7}high ^{A}  
\end{bridge}

\begin{verse}
^{G}To find a queen without a king \hspace{10pt} 
They say she plays guitar and cries ^{D}as she sings \\
^{G}Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn \hspace{10pt}  
Tryin to find a woman whos never, ^{D}never, never been born \\
^{G}Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams, \hspace{10pt}  
Telling myself its not as hard, hard, hard ^{D}as it seems

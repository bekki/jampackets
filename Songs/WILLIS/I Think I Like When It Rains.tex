  \begin{verse}
    ^{A7*}  I think I like when it rains ^{Bm} \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    You told me ^{D7}to go to the ^{A}light \\
    ^{A} And what it's like to feel your ^{Bm}pain \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-}  \hspace{10pt}
    Now I'm okay ^{D7}  if you're alr^{A}ight   \\
    ^{A} I start to wonder why I ^{Bm}came \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    I dreamed of ^{D7}things you said to ^{A}me  \\
    ^{A} We stayed at your place while it ^{Bm}rains \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    We talk and we ^{D7}laugh and watch T^{A}V
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    And I ^{Dmaj7-}couldn't find the ^{Dm}words, I couldn't ^{A}think of what to say \\
    And ^{Dmaj7-}all that I can ^{Dm}do is stop and ^{A}think about the days \\
    When ^{Dmaj7-}all we used to dr^{Dm}eam about was ^{A}meeting after school \\
    And we would ^{Dmaj7-}go on home and ^{Dm}start right back ag^{A}ain
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{A7*} I think I like when it rains ^{Bm} \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    Call up some fri^{D7}ends and have some ^{A}fun  \\
    ^{A} Oh, Lord, I wish things were the ^{Bm}same, nowadays ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    We'll go back to ^{D7}your place when we're ^{A}done  \\
    ^{A} And I got nothing else to ^{Bm}blame \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    I wish the ^{D7}words would come to ^{A}me  \\
    ^{A} We stay at your place while it ^{Bm}rains \hspace{10pt} ^{Dmaj7-} \hspace{10pt}
    We party wh^{D7}ile your mom's asl^{A}eep

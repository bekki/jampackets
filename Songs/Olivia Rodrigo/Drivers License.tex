  \begin{intro}
    _{Bb}
  \end{intro}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Bb}I got my driver's license last week just like we always talked about \\
    ^{Gm}'Cause you were so excited for me to finally drive up to your house \\
    ^{Eb}But today I drove through the suburbs crying 'cause you weren't a^{Bb}round
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Bb}And you're probably with that blonde girl who always made me doubt \\
    ^{Gm}She's so much older than me, she's everything I'm insecure about \\
    Yeah, ^{Eb}today I drove through the suburbs 'cause how could I ever love someone ^{Bb}else?
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    And ^{Ebmaj7}I know we weren't perfect, but I've ^{Ebmaj7}never felt this way for ^{Bb}no one \\
    And ^{Ebmaj7}I just can't imagine how you ^{Ebmaj7}could be so okay now that ^{Bb}I'm gone \\
    Guess ^{Gm*}you didn't ^{F*}mean what you ^{Bb*}wrote in that ^{Dm*}song about ^{Eb*}me \\
    'Cause ^{Cm*}you said forever, now ^{F*}I drive alone past your ^{Bb}street
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Bb}And all my friends are tired of hearing how much I miss you, but \\
    ^{Gm}I kinda feel sorry for them 'cause they'll never know you the way that I do \\
    Yeah, ^{Eb}today I drove through the suburbs and pictured I was driving home ^{Bb}to you
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \instruction{repeat chorus}
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{bridge}
    ^{Gm}Red lights, stop signs, ^{Ebmaj7}I still see your face in the ^{Bb}white cars, front yards \\
    ^{F}Can't drive past the places we ^{Gm}used to go to 'cause ^{Ebmaj7}I still fucking love you, ^{Bb}babe ^{F} \\
    ^{Gm}Sidewalks we crossed, ^{Ebmaj7}I     still hear your voice in the ^{Bb}traffic \\
    We're laughing ^{F}over all the noise. God, I'm ^{Gm}so blue, know we're through \\
    But ^{Ebmaj7}I     still fucking love you, ^{Bb}babe ^{F}
  \end{bridge}

  \begin{outro}
    ... 'cause ^{Cm*}you said forever, now ^{F*}I drive alone past your ^{Gm7*}street

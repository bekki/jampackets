\begin{song}{title={deja vu}, band={Olivia Rodrigo}, year={2021}, key={A}}

\begin{intro}
_{D} \hspace{10pt} _{A}
\end{intro}

\begin{verse}
^{D}Car rides to Malibu, strawberry ^{A}ice cream, one spoon for two \\
And trading ^{D}jackets, laughin' 'bout how small it looks ^{A}on you (ah-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha-ha-ha ha-ha) \\
^{D}Watchin' reruns of Glee, bein' an^{A}noying singin' in harmony \\
I bet she's ^{D}braggin' to all her friends sayin' you're so un^{A}ique (huh) 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{N.C.} So when you gonna ^{D}tell her that we did that too? She thinks it's ^{A}special, but it's all re-used \\
That was our ^{Bm7}place, I found it first, I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with ^{A}you \\
Do you get déjà vu when she's with ^{D}you? Do you get déjà vu, hmm? ^{A}  (hmm) \\
Do ^{N.C.}you get déjà vu, huh? \hspace{10pt} ^{D} \hspace{10pt} ^{A}  
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Do you ^{D}call her, almost say my name? 
'Cause let's be ^{A}honest, we kinda do sound the same \\
Another ^{D}actress, I hate to think that I was just your ^{A}type \\
I bet that ^{D}she knows Billy Joel 'cause you played her Uptown Girl, 
you're ^{A}singin' it together \\
Now I bet you even tell her how you ^{D}love her in between 
the chorus and the ^{A}verse (\eyeroll I love you\eyeroll)
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
^{N.C.} So when you gonna ^{D}tell her that we did that too? 
She thinks it's ^{A}special, but it's all re-used \\
That was the ^{Bm7}show we talked about, played you the songs she's singin' now 
when she's with ^{A}you \\ 
Do you get déjà vu when she's with ^{D}you? 
Do you get déjà vu, oh ^{A}  \\
Do ^{N.C.}you get déjà vu? 
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{D}Strawberry ice cream in Malibu, don't act like we didn't do that shit too \\
^{A}You're trading jackets like we used to do (yeah everything is all re-used) \\
^{D}Play her piano but she doesn't know that I was the one who taught you Billy Joel \\
^{A}A different girl now but there's nothing new (I know you get déjà vu) 
\end{bridge}

\begin{outro}
^{D} \hspace{10pt} ^{A} \hspace{10pt} I know you get déjà vu \\
^{D} \hspace{10pt} ^{A} \hspace{10pt} I know ^{N.C.}you get déjà vu
\end{outro}

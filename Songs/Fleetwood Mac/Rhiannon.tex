  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am}Rhiannon rings like a bell through the night
    and ^{F}wouldn't you love to love her? \\
    ^{Am} Takes to the sky like a bird in flight
    and ^{F}who will be her lover?
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{C} All your life you've never seen a wom^{F}an taken by the wind \\
    ^{C} Would you stay if she promised you heaven?
    ^{F} Will you ever win?
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    ^{Am} She is like a cat in the dark
    and ^{F}then she is the darkness \\
    ^{Am} She rules her life like a fine skylark
    And ^{F}when the sky is starless
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    He ^{F}opens his eyes, falls in ^{Dm}love at first sight
    with the ^{Am}girl in the ^{C}doorway \\
    What ^{F}beautiful lines, ^{Dm}how full of life,
    after ^{Am}thousands of years what a ^{C}face to wake up to \\
    He ^{F}holds back a sigh as she ^{Dm}touches his arm \hspace{10pt}
    She ^{Am}dusts off the bed where 'til ^{C}now he's been sleeping \\
    Under ^{F}miles of stone, the dried ^{Dm}fig of his heart \hspace{10pt}
    Under ^{Am}scarab and bone starts ^{C}back to its beating
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    She ^{F}carries him home in a ^{Dm}beautiful boat \hspace{10pt}
    He ^{Am}watches the scene from a ^{C}porthole in stowage \\
    He can ^{F}hear all she says as she ^{Dm}sits by his bed
    and one ^{Am}day his lips answer her ^{C}in her own language \\
    The ^{F}days quickly pass, he loves ^{Dm}making her laugh \hspace{10pt}
    The ^{Am}first time he moves it's her ^{C}hair that he touches \\
    She asks "^{F}Are you cursed?" He says, "I ^{Dm}think that I'm cured"
    then he ^{Am}talks of the Nile and the ^{C}girls in Bulrushes

  \begin{verse}
    In New ^{F}York he is laid in a ^{Dm}glass covered case \hspace{10pt}
    He ^{Am}pretends he is dead, people ^{C}crowd 'round to see him \\
    But each ^{F}night she comes 'round and the ^{Dm}two wander down \hspace{10pt}
    The ^{Am}halls of the tomb that she ^{C}calls a museum \\
    Often ^{F}he stops to rest, but ^{Dm}then less and less
    then it's ^{Am}her that looks tired, staying ^{C}up asking questions \\
    He ^{F}learns how to read from the ^{Dm}papers that she
    is ^{Am}writing about him and ^{C}he makes corrections
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    It's his ^{F}face on her book, more and ^{Dm}more come to look,
    ^{Am}families from Iowa, ^{C}Upper West Siders \\
    Then one ^{F}day it's too much, he ^{Dm}decides to get up
    and as ^{Am}chaos ensues he walks ^{C}outside to find her \\
    She's ^{F}using a cane and her ^{Dm}face looks too pale
    but she's ^{Am}happy to see him, as they ^{C}walk he supports her \\
    She ^{F}asks "Are you cursed?" but his ^{Dm}answer's obscured
    in a ^{Am}sandstorm of flash bulbs and ^{C}rowdy reporters
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    Such ^{F}reanimation, the ^{Dm}two tour the nation \hspace{10pt}
    He ^{Am}gets out of limos, he ^{C}meets other women \\
    He ^{F}speaks of her fondly, their ^{Dm}nights in the museum
    but she's ^{Am}just one more rag now he's ^{C}dragging behind him \\
    She ^{F}stops going out, she just ^{Dm}lies there in bed
    in ^{Am}hotels in whatever ^{C}towns they are speaking \\
    Then her ^{F}face starts to set and her ^{Dm}hands start to fold \hspace{10pt}
    Then one ^{Am}day the dried fig of her ^{C}heart stops its beating

  \begin{verse}
    Long a^{F}go on the ship, she asked, "^{Dm}Why pyramids?" \hspace{10pt}
    He said, "^{Am}Think of them as an im^{C}mense invitation" \\
    She ^{F}asked, "Are you cursed?" He said, "I ^{Dm}think that I'm cured" \hspace{10pt}
    Then he ^{Am}kissed her and hoped that she'd ^{C}forget that question \instruction{pause}

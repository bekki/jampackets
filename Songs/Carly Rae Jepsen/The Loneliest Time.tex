\begin{verse}
I've had ^{D}one of those bad dreams ^{A}
where we're ^{C}standing on your street \\
^{C-B7} I quit ^{Em}smoking those cigarettes ^{F#m} 
But I'm ^{G}never getting over it ^{G} \\
And you're ^{D}lookin' right through me ^{A}
Just like ^{C}Shakespeare wrote a tragedy \\
^{C-B7} 'Bout our ^{Em}story, never finished it ^{Bm} 
'Cause our ^{G}love, we never finished it ^{G}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
I'm coming ^{D}over tonight ^{A}
Knock on your ^{C}door, just like be^{B7}fore \\
I need that ^{Em}look in your eyes (Look in your ^{F#m}eyes)
'Cause we've had the ^{A}loneliest time (Loneliest ^{A}time) \\
I'm thinking ^{D}all through the night (All through the ^{A}night)
I could be ^{C}yours, just like be^{B7}fore \\
Rewrite a^{Em}nother try ^{F#m} 
'Cause we've had the ^{A}loneliest ^{A}time
\end{chorus}

\begin{postchorus}
If you wanna ^{G-}try it^{F#m}, if you wanna ^{Em}try me \hspace{10pt}
If you wanna ^{G-}try, love^{F#m},  if you leave the ^{Em}light on for me \\
If you wanna ^{G-}try it^{F#m},  if you wanna ^{Em}try it \hspace{10pt}
If you wanna ^{A}try, love ^{A}
\end{postchorus}

\begin{verse}
\instruction{Rufus:}
I've had ^{D}more of those bad dreams, ^{A}
you were ^{C}ten feet in front of me \\
^{C-B7} I went ^{Em}running, but I couldn't catch 
^{D} just the ^{G}shadow of your silhouette ^{A}  \\
\instruction{Carly:} Then you ^{D}spoke the words to me ^{A}
When you ^{C}left, I still need to unpack it \\
^{C-B7} Let's save ^{Em}sorry for another night ^{D}
'Cause this time, ^{A}love, we're gonna get it right
\end{verse}

\begin{postchorus}
If you wanna ^{G}try it ^{F#m},  if you wanna ^{Em}try, love \hspace{10pt}
If you wanna ^{G}try, love ^{F#m},  if you leave the ^{Em}light on for me \\
If you wanna ^{G}try it ^{F#m},  if you leave the ^{Em}light on for me \hspace{10pt}
^{A}I just need back into, I just need back into your life
\end{postchorus}

\begin{bridge}
^{D*} What happened was ^{A*} we reached the moon
^{C} But lost in space, I think we got there, ^{B7}oh, too soon \\
^{Em}  But you know what? ^{D} I'm coming ^{A}back for you, baby
^{A}I'm coming back for you

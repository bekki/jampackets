  \begin{verse}
    I didn't ^{Bm7}know that I was capable of being ^{Bm7}happy right now
    but ^{Amaj7}you showed me how ^{Amaj7} \\
    I didn't ^{Bm7}know that you were right in front of me ^{Bm7}
    until I ^{Amaj7}looked out  ^{Amaj7-E}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    ^{Bm7}You make me wanna cry in a ^{Bm7}good way \hspace{10pt}

  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    You weigh ^{Bm7}just as much as me, don't you, ^{Bm7}
    I can feel it when we ^{Amaj7}touch ^{Amaj7} \\
    I ^{Bm7}know you've been having night^{Bm7}mares lately
    and I'm sorry I ^{Amaj7}fall asleep first ^{Amaj7-E}
